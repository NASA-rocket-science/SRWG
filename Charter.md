# NASA Sounding Rocket Working Group Charter
Effective Date - July 1989

## Purpose

To counsel the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) 
on the performance and plans of the NASA Sounding Rocket Program, 
with particular emphasis on the operation and support of sounding rocket payloads.

To provide a forum for exchange of information on sounding rocket 
systems, operational support, and developments in science as they 
affect the Sounding Rocket Program.

## Membership

The Working Group will consist of approximately twelve members, 
one of whom will be the NASA Sounding Rocket Project Scientist, 
who will serve as Chairman.  The other members will be appointed 
from the principal scientific disciplines served by sounding rockets 
and from the technical and management support areas of importance to 
the NASA Sounding Rocket Program.  Members will be appointed by the 
Director, Goddard Space Flight Center.

## Terms of Service

Except for the Project Scientist, terms of service of the members 
shall normally be three years.

## Implementation

Meetings will be held as needed but not less than twice yearly.  
The Chairman shall invite any participants necessary to accomplish 
the business of the meetings.  The agenda for the meetings will 
normally be established by the chairman at least six weeks prior 
to each meeting.  The NSRWG advice will be reported to the Sounding 
Rocket Project Manager at Goddard Space Flight Center/Wallops Flight 
Facility (GSFC/WFF) in addition to the Chairman's normal reporting 
to the GSFC Center Director.  The minutes of the meetings will be 
distributed to both the Sounding Rocket Project Manager at GSFC/WFF 
and to the Sounding Rocket Program Manager at NASA Headquarters.

### Project Scientist
The Project Scientist is from the Space 
and Earth Sciences Directorate, GSFC, and serves as Chairman of 
the Sounding Rocket Working Group (SRWG).  On a daily basis, the 
Project Scientist represents the interests of the sounding rocket 
investigators in working with the Project. The Project Scientist 
also evaluates all scientific and engineering requirements placed 
on the Sounding Rocket Program and provides guidance to the NASA 
Headquarters Program Manager, the Sounding Rocket Project Manager 
at GSFC/WFF, and all others involved in the Program.  The Project 
Scientist reports to the Center Director, GSFC.
